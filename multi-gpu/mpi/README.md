# Multi-GPU exercise with MPI

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of MPI for GPU-GPU communication. The program performs an MPI transfer between two processes using host data and device data. The device data transfer is demonstrated by two methods; by using a manual host staging, and directly passing device pointers to MPI. Fill the blanks indicated by #error.
