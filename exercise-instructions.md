# Generic instructions for the exercises

For most of the exercises, skeleton codes are provided to serve as a starting
point. Some may have sections marked with TODO to indicate a place in the
code where something is missing or needs to be changed.

In addition, all of the exercises have example solutions in a `solution`
subdirectory. Note that these are seldom the only or even the best way to
solve the problem.

All of the exercise materials can be downloaded with the command

```
git clone https://github.com/csc-training/hip-programming.git
```
